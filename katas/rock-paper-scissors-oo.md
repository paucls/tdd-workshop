# Rock Paper Scissors Kata
Kata for practicing OO style programming

The inspiration for this Kata comes from an example in the book
 [Object Design: Roles, Responsibilities, and Collaborations](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Object-Design-Responsibilities-Collaborations-Addison-Wesley/dp/0201379430) and the
  rules in the [Object Calisthenics](https://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/luontola/tdd-2009/ext/ObjectCalisthenics.pdf) paper by Jeff Bay.
## Description


>The game has only three possible outcomes other than a tie: a player who decides to play rock will beat another player who has chosen scissors (rock crushes scissors) but will lose to one who has played paper (paper covers rock); a play of paper will lose to a play of scissors (scissors cut paper). If both players throw the same shape, the game is tied and is usually immediately replayed to break the tie.

## Kata Rules

### Stage 1
Write code to determine whether one shape object beats another.
e.g. aPaper.beats(aRock)

Do this for all combinations

> rock crushes scissors

> paper covers rock

> scissors cut paper

### Stage 2
Refactor your code to adhere to these rules:
* One level of indentation per method
* One dot per line
* Donâ€™t use if, else or case statements

### Stage 3
Add Spock and Lizard to the equation:

> Spock smashes scissors and vaporizes rock

> Spock is poisoned by lizard and disproven by paper

> Lizard poisons Spock and eats paper

> Lizard is crushed by rock and decapitated by scissors

### Stage 4
Create a Game object that will simulate 2 players throwing shapes until
one player wins the best of 7.

Each round must be printed showing the shapes thrown by both players, the
result of the round and a running total of the scores.
