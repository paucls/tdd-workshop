# Fibonacci sequence

The Fibonacci sequence starts with the numbers zero and one, and then every number after the first two is the sum of the two preceding ones.

```
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ...
```

Your task is to write some code to calculate and return the Fibonacci number at a given position in the sequence.

The position can be provided as a zero-indexed integer (e.g., position 0 returns 0, position 1 returns 1, and so on).

**Input**: A non-negative integer representing the position in the Fibonacci sequence.

**Output**: The Fibonacci number at that position.
